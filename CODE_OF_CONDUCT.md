# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as maintainers and contributors pledge to provide a welcoming, harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior. We reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject
contributions or other interactions that do not align with this Code of
Conduct, and we will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is officially representing the project or its community.
Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an
official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the maintainer team at opensource@orbit.dev. If email is not
possible, you may open a private report via the "Report a vulnerability"
workflow on GitHub so the maintainers can reach out directly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The
maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter
of any incident.
