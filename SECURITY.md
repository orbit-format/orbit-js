# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep orbit-js and its users safe.

## Supported versions

We currently provide security fixes for the latest released version of the
`orbit-js` npm package. If you rely on an older version you may need to upgrade
before receiving a fix.

## Reporting a vulnerability

1. **Do not open a public issue.** Public issues make it harder for everyone to
   stay safe.
2. Use GitHub's private reporting workflow by clicking the _Report a
   vulnerability_ button on the repository's Security tab, or visit:
   https://github.com/orbit-format/orbit-js/security/advisories/new
3. Include as much detail as possible: reproduction steps, impacted versions,
   and suggested mitigations if you have any.

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**.
- The maintainer team will investigate and keep you updated about status and
  timelines.
- Once a fix is ready we will coordinate a disclosure date so downstream users
  can update before details become public.
- Credits will be given (if desired) in the release notes.

Thank you for responsibly disclosing security issues.
